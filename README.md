  👋 Hi, I’m Ayesha Tahir
-    Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Computer Science student currently in my first semester, exploring the fascinating world of programming with C++.
     While I'm still discovering my interests in tech, I enjoy learning and experimenting with code to solve problems and create cool projects.
     Beyond tech, I'm passionate about cooking, and I find joy in crafting delicious recipes almost as much as writing code.
